Dear Rahul, 
I am writing to inform you that I will be on leave today. However, I expect all tasks and work to be completed as scheduled. 
Please ensure that all deadlines are met and work is done efficiently. 
If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
Regards, 
Vedanga
